# svg-logo-maker

## Description

I created this SVG-Logo-Maker to make it easier for freelance web developers to generate a simple logo for projects. This avoids having to pay a graphic designer. While working on this command line application, I gained greater understanding of testing, classes, and validation. I also learned how to format and style SVGs, which I had not worked with prior to this project.

## Installation

In order to use the SVG-Logo Maker, the user must install node.js. Node.js can be installed using this link: https://nodejs.org/en/download. It's important to download the LTS option for the computer's operating system. Next, the user will need to install the inquirer package by inputting "npm i inquirer@8.2.4" in the command line. Finally, the user needs to install jest for running the tests. Jest can be installed by running "npm install --save-dev jest" in the command line. Please make sure that test is set to "jest" in the package.json. More information about jest can be found here: https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started. After completing these steps, the user will be ready to use the SVG-Logo Maker.
